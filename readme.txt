The workflow:

Put all three '*.sty' files ang 'images' folder in the same directory as
'template.tex'. Unzipping this archive produces a correct file structure.

Compile 'template.tex' using PDFLaTeX or XeLaTex. Enjoy the obtained
'template.pdf' =)

I'll be glad to hear all you suggestions, opinions, critique, requests,
advice, etc.
